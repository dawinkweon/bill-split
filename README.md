# bill-split
## Overview
Simple tool to split costs between people at parties and gatherings.

## Motivation
The motivation came from a group of 10 at a skewers shop. 

Those that don't eat a lot and can't drink alcohol, had to face the unfairness of paying the big bucks. 
It can get troublesome settling costs especially in a large group.
We've tried tools like Splitwise and stock notes applications, but none did the trick.

This tool when used on-the-fly while ordering food is a godsend!

## Issues
There's a performance issue when there are a large number of rows, due to a high number of localStorage put calls.
